# MedDoraemon

This is a collection of commonly used scripts for biomedical image analysis (for internal usage purposes)

Remarks:
1. Use Clear and Descriptive Function Names with lowercase words separated by underscores, e.g., `def calculate_average_score(scores)`
2. Use a consistent docstring style like [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
3. Use `try/except` blocks thoughtfully to handle errors gracefully.

Example 

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Add two integers and return the result.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number.
        b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b

```
